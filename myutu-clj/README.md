# myutu-clj

FIXME: description

I'm leaving boilerplate above and below for now. But if you want to try this
out, install leiningen (follow instructions on their website). Then from this
directory:

  $ lein install
  $ lein run [some-file.yaml]

You'll exercise the `-main` function in `src/myutu_clj/core.clj`, which both
parses and generates some YAML. No reading from files yet.

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar myutu-clj-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
