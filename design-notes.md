# The thing we're working on #

Note that everything except this and the following block (as of initial commit
of this file) was the default export from
[Checkvist](https://checkvist.com/checklists/6040040) -> Markdown. This line
breaks the checkvist outline ordering of elements, but seems appropriate as a
note. I'd propose that our spec allows for a note directly under the title of
the document, and that it have a separate status, perhaps "metadata". Also
perhaps we can have style guidelines wherin we drop the perverse style of
putting punctuation inside of a closing quote.

When there's lots of depth (>4 levels), default Markdown rendering looks good.
When you have nothing but level 3 headings in a run, it looks less good. So, we
might want to tweak things a bit. A primary question for now is how much do we
care about standard markdown rendering? Syntactically, it doesn't really make
our job that much harder to parse this document into a proper outline vs. a
pure markdown list w/ sub-lists. I think the main design constraint for this
should be ergonomic - we're mostly going to interact with this in a text editor
for now.
