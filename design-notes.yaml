title: The thing we're working on
# I used description instead of a more general metadata here, as it seems to
# clearly denote an "intelligent reader" is required to read it, as compared to
# metadata that might be more readily machine usable. Note also, YAML supports
# comments, which is nice.

    This is a first effort at converting the markdown version of this document
    to YAML. The Markdown was an export from
    [Checkvist](https://checkvist.com/checklists/6040040) -> Markdown. This
    line breaks the checkvist outline ordering of elements, but seems
    appropriate as a note. I'd propose that our spec allows for a note directly
    under the title of the document, and that it have a separate status,
    perhaps "metadata". Also perhaps we can have style guidelines wherin we
    drop the perverse style of putting punctuation inside of a closing quote.

  # This goes in a separate item because `>` can't support newlines - all
  # whitespace becomes literal spaces.

    When there's lots of depth (>4 levels), default Markdown rendering looks
    good.  When you have nothing but level 3 headings in a run, it looks less
    good. So, we might want to tweak things a bit. A primary question for now
    is how much do we care about standard markdown rendering? Syntactically, it
    doesn't really make our job that much harder to parse this document into a
    proper outline vs. a pure markdown list w/ sub-lists. I think the main
    design constraint for this should be ergonomic - we're mostly going to
    interact with this in a text editor for now.
